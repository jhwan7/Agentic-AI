C) Explicit state management and conditional flows  
D) Better model integration  

<details><summary>💡 Answer & Explanation</summary>
<strong>C) Explicit state management and conditional flows</strong><br><br>
LangGraph enables complex workflows with branching logic, loops, and explicit state transitions. Unlike linear chains, it can handle dynamic routing and complex multi-agent orchestration.
</details>

---

### **35. In a multi-agent system, what pattern should you use for task delegation?**
A) All agents work on everything simultaneously  
B) Specialized agents with a coordinator/router  
C) Random assignment of tasks  
D) Single agent handles all tasks  

<details><summary>💡 Answer & Explanation</summary>
<strong>B) Specialized agents with a coordinator/router</strong><br><br>
Effective multi-agent systems use specialized agents (research, math, writing) coordinated by a router that determines which agent should handle each task based on the request type.
</details>

---

### **36. What is a "state" in the context of LangGraph?**
A) The current model being used  
B) A data structure passed between graph nodes  
C) The agent's mood or personality  
D) The physical server status  

<details><summary>💡 Answer & Explanation</summary>
<strong>B) A data structure passed between graph nodes</strong><br><br>
In LangGraph, state is a shared data structure (often a dictionary) that flows through the graph, allowing nodes to read previous results and add their own outputs for subsequent nodes.
</details>

---

### **37. When should you use multiple agents instead of a single agent with many tools?**
A) Never - single agents are always better  
B) When tasks require different expertise domains or conflicting objectives  
C) Only for cost optimization  
D) When you have multiple users  

<details><summary>💡 Answer & Explanation</summary>
<strong>B) When tasks require different expertise domains or conflicting objectives</strong><br><br>
Multi-agent systems excel when tasks require fundamentally different approaches (creative vs analytical), specialized knowledge domains, or when agents need different prompting strategies.
</details>

---

### **38. What's the key benefit of LangGraph's conditional edges?**
A) Faster graph execution  
B) Dynamic routing based on agent outputs or state  
C) Reduced memory usage  
D) Better error messages  

<details><summary>💡 Answer & Explanation</summary>
<strong>B) Dynamic routing based on agent outputs or state</strong><br><br>
Conditional edges allow the workflow to branch dynamically based on previous results, enabling complex decision trees and adaptive workflows that respond to changing conditions.
</details>

---

### **39. In LangGraph, what happens if you create a cycle without proper exit conditions?**
A) The graph automatically optimizes itself  
B) It creates an infinite loop and potential runaway costs  
C) The system switches to a backup model  
D) Graph execution becomes faster  

<details><summary>💡 Answer & Explanation</summary>
<strong>B) It creates an infinite loop and potential runaway costs</strong><br><br>
Like any programming loop, LangGraph cycles need explicit exit conditions. Without them, the graph can loop indefinitely, consuming unlimited tokens and generating massive costs.
</details>

</details>

---

### **42. Which memory type is most appropriate for storing user preferences across sessions?**
A) ConversationBufferMemory  
B) VectorStoreRetrieverMemory with user metadata  
C) ConversationSummaryMemory  
D) No persistent memory needed  

<details><summary>💡 Answer & Explanation</summary>
<strong>B) VectorStoreRetrieverMemory with user metadata</strong><br><br>
User preferences need to persist across sessions and be retrievable based on context. Vector stores with metadata filtering allow agents to recall relevant preferences when needed, unlike conversation buffers that reset.
</details>

---

### **43. What is "reflection" in the context of agent feedback loops?**
A) Agents looking at themselves in mirrors  
B) Agents evaluating and critiquing their own outputs  
C) Copying behavior from other agents  
D) Reverting to previous states  

<details><summary>💡 Answer & Explanation</summary>
<strong>C) Agents evaluating and critiquing their own outputs</strong><br><br>
Reflection involves agents analyzing their own responses, checking for errors, assessing quality, and determining if their output meets the requirements before finalizing or improving it.
</details>

## 🛡️ **Safety & Evaluation (Questions 44-47)**

### **44. What is prompt injection, and why is it dangerous for agents?**
A) Adding too many prompts at once  
B) Malicious inputs that override agent instructions  
C) Using the wrong model parameters  
D) Injecting code into model training  

<details><summary>💡 Answer & Explanation</summary>
<strong>B) Malicious inputs that override agent instructions</strong><br><br>
Prompt injection attacks try to make agents ignore their original instructions and follow malicious commands instead. This can lead to data breaches, unauthorized actions, or harmful outputs.
</details>

---

### **45. Which testing approach is most important for agent safety?**
A) Only test happy path scenarios  
B) Test edge cases, failure modes, and adversarial inputs  
C) Test only with perfect, clean inputs  
D) Testing isn't necessary for AI systems  

<details><summary>💡 Answer & Explanation</summary>
<strong>B) Test edge cases, failure modes, and adversarial inputs</strong><br><br>
Agents can fail in unexpected ways. Testing must include malformed inputs, prompt injection attempts, boundary conditions, and scenarios where tools fail to ensure robust behavior.
</details>

---

### **46. What is the purpose of a circuit breaker in agent systems?**
A) To control electrical power  
B) To prevent cascading failures by stopping requests when error rates are high  
C) To switch between different models  
D) To reduce memory usage  

<details><summary>💡 Answer & Explanation</summary>
<strong>B) To prevent cascading failures by stopping requests when error rates are high</strong><br><br>
Circuit breakers monitor failure rates and temporarily halt operations when thresholds are exceeded, preventing system overload and allowing time for recovery.
</details>
