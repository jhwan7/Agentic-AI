## üß∞ **Frameworks & Ecosystems (Questions 18-22)**

### **18. What is the primary purpose of LangChain?**
A) Training custom language models  
B) Building applications and agents with LLMs  
C) Hosting and serving AI models  
D) Data preprocessing and cleaning  

<details><summary>üí° Answer & Explanation</summary>
<strong>B) Building applications and agents with LLMs</strong><br><br>
LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. It provides tools for chaining operations, managing memory, integrating tools, and building complex AI workflows.
</details>

---

### **19. Which LangChain function is DEPRECATED and should not be used in modern code?**
A) `create_react_agent()`  
B) `initialize_agent()`  
C) `AgentExecutor()`  
D) `ChatOllama()`  

<details><summary>üí° Answer & Explanation</summary>
<strong>B) `initialize_agent()`</strong><br><br>
`initialize_agent()` is deprecated in favor of `create_react_agent()` + `AgentExecutor`. Modern LangChain code should use the newer, more flexible agent creation patterns.
</details>

---

### **20. What makes Ollama particularly useful for agent development?**
A) It's the fastest inference engine  
B) It enables local model hosting without API costs  
C) It only works with the best models  
D) It automatically optimizes prompts  

<details><summary>üí° Answer & Explanation</summary>
<strong>B) It enables local model hosting without API costs</strong><br><br>
Ollama allows developers to run models locally, eliminating API costs and latency while maintaining privacy. This is especially valuable for development, testing, and cost-sensitive applications.
</details>

---

### **21. In modern LangChain (v0.1+), how should you define agent tools?**
A) As Python functions with docstrings  
B) Using the `@tool` decorator with type hints  
C) As JSON configuration files  
D) Through YAML definitions  

<details><summary>üí° Answer & Explanation</summary>
<strong>B) Using the `@tool` decorator with type hints</strong><br><br>
The `@tool` decorator with proper type hints and docstrings is the modern way to create tools. This provides automatic validation, better error handling, and clear documentation for the agent.
</details>

---

### **22. What is the correct modern pattern for creating a ReAct agent?**
A) `agent = initialize_agent(tools, llm, agent="zero-shot-react")`  
B) `agent = create_react_agent(llm, tools, prompt); executor = AgentExecutor(agent, tools)`  
C) `agent = ReActAgent(llm, tools)`  
D) `agent = LangChain.create_agent(type="react")`  

<details><summary>üí° Answer & Explanation</summary>
<strong>B) `agent = create_react_agent(llm, tools, prompt); executor = AgentExecutor(agent, tools)`</strong><br><br>
Modern LangChain separates agent creation from execution. You create the agent with `create_react_agent()`, then wrap it in an `AgentExecutor` for actual operation with proper error handling and controls.
</details>

## üîç **RAG and Vector Memory (Questions 23-28)**

### **23. What problem does RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) primarily solve?**
A) Slow model inference speed  
B) High API costs  
C) Knowledge limitations beyond training data  
D) Complex prompt engineering  

<details><summary>üí° Answer & Explanation</summary>
<strong>C) Knowledge limitations beyond training data</strong><br><br>
RAG allows agents to access external, current information that wasn't in the model's training data. This enables factual accuracy and access to private or recent information.
</details>

---

### **24. What are embeddings in the context of vector databases?**
A) Compressed versions of documents  
B) Numerical representations of text that capture semantic meaning  
C) Metadata about document structure  
D) Encryption keys for secure storage  

<details><summary>üí° Answer & Explanation</summary>
<strong>B) Numerical representations of text that capture semantic meaning</strong><br><br>
Embeddings convert text into high-dimensional vectors where semantically similar content has similar vector representations, enabling meaningful similarity search.
</details>

---

### **25. Why is chunking important in RAG systems?**
A) It reduces storage costs  
B) It makes documents searchable and fits context windows  
C) It improves model training speed  
D) It encrypts sensitive information  

<details><summary>üí° Answer & Explanation</summary>
<strong>B) It makes documents searchable and fits context windows</strong><br><br>
Chunking breaks large documents into smaller, searchable pieces that can fit within LLM context limits while maintaining semantic coherence for effective retrieval.
</details>

---

### **26. What is the recommended chunk overlap percentage when splitting documents?**
A) 0% (no overlap)  
B) 10-20% overlap  
C) 50% overlap  
D) 90% overlap  

<details><summary>üí° Answer & Explanation</summary>
<strong>B) 10-20% overlap</strong><br><br>
A 10-20% overlap (e.g., 50 tokens on 500-token chunks) prevents important context from being lost at chunk boundaries while avoiding excessive redundancy.
</details>

---

### **27. Which vector database is best for local development and prototyping?**
A) Pinecone (cloud)  
B) Weaviate (self-hosted)  
C) Chroma (local)  
D) FAISS (library)  

<details><summary>üí° Answer & Explanation</summary>
<strong>C) Chroma (local)</strong><br><br>
Chroma is designed for local development with easy setup and minimal configuration, making it ideal for prototyping RAG systems before moving to production databases.
</details>

---

### **28. What's the advantage of hybrid search (vector + keyword) over pure vector search?**
A) It's faster  
B) It's cheaper  
C) It combines semantic similarity with exact term matching  
D) It requires less storage  

<details><summary>üí° Answer & Explanation</summary>
<strong>C) It combines semantic similarity with exact term matching</strong><br><br>
Hybrid search gets the best of both worlds: vector search finds semantically related content while keyword search ensures exact terms aren't missed, improving overall retrieval quality.
</details>

## üîß **Modern Agent Implementation (Questions 29-33)**

### **29. What's wrong with this tool definition?**
```python
@tool
def divide(a, b):
    return a / b
```
A) Missing type hints  
B) No error handling for division by zero  
C) Missing docstring  
D) All of the above  

<details><summary>üí° Answer & Explanation</summary>
<strong>D) All of the above</strong><br><br>
Modern tools need type hints (`a: float, b: float -> str`), comprehensive error handling (division by zero), and clear docstrings for the agent to understand when and how to use the tool.
</details>

---

### **30. What's the purpose of `max_iterations` in AgentExecutor?**
A) To improve performance  
B) To prevent infinite loops and runaway costs  
C) To increase accuracy  
D) To enable parallel processing  

<details><summary>üí° Answer & Explanation</summary>
<strong>B) To prevent infinite loops and runaway costs</strong><br><br>
`max_iterations` prevents agents from getting stuck in endless loops, which can consume unlimited tokens and generate massive costs. It's a crucial safety mechanism.
</details>

---

### **31. What type of memory is best for keeping recent conversation context?**
A) `ConversationBufferMemory` (unlimited)  
B) `ConversationBufferWindowMemory` (last N exchanges)  
C) `VectorStoreRetrieverMemory` (semantic search)  
D) `ConversationSummaryMemory` (compressed)  

<details><summary>üí° Answer & Explanation</summary>
<strong>B) `ConversationBufferWindowMemory` (last N exchanges)</strong><br><br>
Window memory keeps the most recent N exchanges, preventing unlimited growth while maintaining recent context. This balances memory and performance effectively.
</details>

---

### **32. In a production agent, what should you do when a tool call fails?**
A) Crash the entire agent  
B) Return a helpful error message to the agent  
C) Ignore the error and continue  
D) Retry indefinitely  

<details><summary>üí° Answer & Explanation</summary>
<strong>B) Return a helpful error message to the agent</strong><br><br>
Tools should catch exceptions and return informative error messages that help the agent understand what went wrong and potentially try alternative approaches.
</details>

---

### **33. What's the correct way to handle environment variables for API keys?**
A) Hard-code them in the source code  
B) Put them in version control  
C) Use `os.getenv()` with error handling  
D) Store them in database  

<details><summary>üí° Answer & Explanation</summary>
<strong>C) Use `os.getenv()` with error handling</strong><br><br>
```python
api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
if not api_key:
    raise ValueError("OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable not set")
```
This keeps secrets secure and provides clear error messages when configuration is missing.
</details>

## üí° **Practical Implementation Challenge**

**Bonus Question**: You're building a RAG agent that sometimes returns "No relevant information found" even when relevant docs exist. What are the three most likely causes?

<details><summary>üîß Common RAG Issues & Solutions</summary>
<strong>1. Poor Chunking Strategy</strong><br>
- Chunks too large/small or bad splitting points<br>
- Solution: Use semantic splitters with appropriate overlap<br><br>

<strong>2. Embedding Model Mismatch</strong><br>
- Query and document embeddings from different models<br>
- Solution: Use same embedding model for ingestion and retrieval<br><br>

<strong>3. Insufficient Similarity Threshold</strong><br>
- Search threshold too restrictive<br>
- Solution: Tune similarity thresholds and increase `k` (number of results)
</details>
