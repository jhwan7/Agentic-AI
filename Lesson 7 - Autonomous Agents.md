# 🤖 Lesson 7 — Autonomous Agents & LangGraph Integration

---

## 📚 What You Learned

In this lesson, you learned how to build autonomous, goal-driven agents using **LangGraph** and **LangChain**.

---

## 🧠 Part 1: What Is an Autonomous Agent?

| Trait | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 🎯 Goal-Oriented | Agent receives a high-level task |
| 🔁 Looping | Plans → acts → reflects → adjusts |
| 🛠 Tool-Using | Calls APIs/functions during reasoning |
| 🧠 Reflective | Critiques itself and retries |
| 📦 Stateful | Tracks attempts, steps, progress |

Agent behavior resembles:
```text
Thought → Action → Observation → Thought → Final Answer
```

---

## 🧩 Part 2: Wrapping LangChain Agents as LangGraph Nodes

You wrapped a LangChain ReAct agent using tools and dropped it into a LangGraph node:

```python
def react_agent_node(state):
    response = agent.run(state["input"])
    return {"output": response}
```

| Component | Role |
|----------|------|
| LangChain Agent | Thinks, acts, decides |
| LangGraph Node | Handles flow control and routing |
| Shared State | Carries memory between nodes |

---

## 🧱 Part 3: Autonomous Planner + Executor System

Full multi-node agent with memory and feedback:

```text
input → planner → executor → critic → router → (done or retry)
```

### Key Nodes

```python
# planner.py
def planner_node(state): ...

# agent_executor.py
def agent_executor_node(state): ...

# critic.py
def critic_node(state): ...

# route_after_critic
def route_after_critic(state):
    return "executor" if not state["approved"] else "done"
```

### Shared State

```python
{
  "input": "Build a calculator",
  "steps": [...],
  "current_step": "...",
  "output": "...",
  "approved": False,
  "attempts": 0
}
```

## 🚀 Part 4: Deployment & Best Practices

| Tip | Why It Helps |
|-----|--------------|
| Modularize code | Makes it testable, scalable |
| Add retry limits | Prevent infinite loops |
| Persist state | Use Redis, JSON, or vector DB |
| Dockerize | Portable and reproducible |
| Build UI or API | FastAPI, Streamlit, Gradio for UX |
